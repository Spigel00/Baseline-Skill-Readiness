We evaluate a range of heuristics including heading detection, caption extraction, and reference linking. Our results show that hybrid rule-based approaches outperform naive text extraction in cases where document structure is partially preserved. The study aims to assist researchers developing automated metadata generation pipelines",

    "title_full": "Introduction Scientific documents are commonly distributed in PDF and DOCX formats, each presenting unique challenges for automated extraction. PDFs often lose logical reading order, while DOCX files retain semantic structure such as headings and styled paragraphs. This paper evaluates methods to reliably extract headings, captions, references, and other metadata components from both formats",

This suggests the need for hybrid techniques that combine rule-based logic with ML-driven classification.
