We evaluate a range of heuristics including\nheading detection, caption extraction, and reference linking. Our results show that hybrid\nrule-based approaches outperform naive text extraction in cases where document structure is\npartially preserved. The study aims to assist researchers developing automated metadata\ngeneration pipelines.\n1. Introduction\nScientific documents are commonly distributed in PDF and DOCX formats, each presenting unique\nchallenges for automated extraction. PDFs often lose logical reading order, while DOCX files retain\nsemantic structure such as headings and styled paragraphs.\nThis paper evaluates methods to reliably extract headings, captions, references, and other\nmetadata components from both formats.\n2. Related Work\nPrevious studies have explored layout-aware extraction, natural language processing pipelines,\nand machine learning models for document segmentation. However, limited work focuses on\nlightweight, rule-based approaches suitable for small-scale research workflows.\nRecent advancements in agentic AI systems offer new opportunities for semi-automated document\nprocessing pipelines.\n3. Methodology\nOur approach evaluates three categories of extraction techniques: rule-based heuristics,\nregex-driven caption detection, and block-based text grouping for PDFs.\nFigure 1 illustrates the overall extraction pipeline used in our experiments. Table 1 summarizes the\ndocuments included in the dataset.\n4. Results\nFigure 2 highlights the accuracy comparison between PDF and DOCX extraction outputs. We\nobserved that DOCX-based extraction consistently outperformed PDF-based extraction due to\nricher structural metadata.\nTable 2 presents performance metrics including precision and recall for heading and caption\ndetection tasks.\n5. Discussion\nWhile rule-based methods are interpretable and lightweight, they fail in cases where documents\nfollow unconventional layouts. This suggests the need for hybrid techniques that combine\nrule-based logic with ML-driven classification.\nFuture work includes integrating transformer-based models to detect semantic sections and\nimprove caption-reference linking accuracy.\n6. Conclusion\nThis study demonstrates the effectiveness of structure-aware extraction heuristics for scientific\ndocuments. Our findings provide a foundation for building scalable, automated metadata generation\npipelines.\nFigures\nFigure 1: Overview of the extraction pipeline architecture.\nFigure 2: Accuracy comparison between PDF and DOCX extraction techniques.\nTables\nTable 1: Dataset summary including document counts and formats.\nTable 2: Performance metrics for heading and caption detection tasks."
